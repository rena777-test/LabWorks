                The competitions of the final stage of the "Autumn Cup" took place.
                Based on its results, the winner and prize-winners of the tournament were
                determined.

                The competitions of the final stage of the "Autumn Cup" took place.
                Based on its results, the winner and prize-winners of the tournament were
                determined.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Mad Head competition is the fifth and final stage of the Fall Cup of
                the seventh season of the Battle of the Corporations. 17 teams took part
                in it. For two and a half hours, the participants answered the questions
                of the presenter on various topics, showing not only erudition, but also
                intuition and ingenuity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first team with a score of 31.5 points was the team "Nertus", the second
                finished last year's winners "Creator IQ" (30), and the third again were the
                players of "Alfa-Bank" (28.5 points).
            </p>
            <p>
                Considering the results of performances at the previous stages (karting, darts
                and mini-football), the "Autumn Cup" was won by "Creator IQ". In the "last bend"
                the winners were able to bypass the leader of the season after the first four
                stages, the "Staleks", which took only seventh place at the "Mad Head" stage.
                The third place is taken by the employees of the "Hello" company. Consistently
                high results throughout all stages, especially the "silver" in mini-football
                competitions, allowed them to get the bronze Cup of the autumn part of the
                season.
            </p>
            <p>
                In February the teams will start fighting in the new five stages of the "Spring Cup".
                The first is bowling.
